{"name":"Xambi","tagline":"XAmbi RF Network with RPI Board and XambiKids","body":"XAmbi Network\r\n----------------\r\nBy Frank Herrmann (xpixer@gmail.com)\r\n<br/>\r\nXAmbi Network with Atmel Attiny and RFM12B\r\n\r\n![XAmbi_kid_dht11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpix/XAmbi/master/Xambi_kids/PROTOTYPE/xambikid_solar/IMG_2516.JPG)\r\n\r\n##Synopsis\r\nThe XAmbi Network system are a bunch of Sensor nodes and a Raspberry Gateway. This can control everything in your house and get the data in a nice Webinterface.\r\nThis is the Hardware section, here the Software part: [Webinterface](https://github.com/xpix/xambiserver) with MQTT Support. \r\n\r\nWhat do you need for the first start are follow components:\r\n- a [RaspberryPi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) with installed [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software))\r\n- a [Jeenode](http://jeelabs.net/projects/hardware/wiki/JeeNode) connected via USB or Serial to RPI\r\n- one or more [xambi sensor](https://github.com/xpix/XAmbi/tree/master/Xambi_kids/xambikid_mainboard) nodes with an RFM12B Transceiver\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n- the xambi network system are very modular\r\n- one Gateway with max 999 nodes\r\n- very low bit rate for stable and long range communicaton via [Jeelib](http://jeelabs.net/pub/docs/jeelib/)\r\n- sensor board a kind of breadboard to connect sensors very easy\r\n- Boost to 3.3V on sensor board to get all energy from battery cell\r\n- mainboard very small and standard sizes for normal enclousures\r\n\r\n##Examples\r\n- DHT11 [temperature and humidity Sensor](https://github.com/xpix/XAmbi/tree/master/Xambi_kids/xambikid_dht11)\r\n- Dalles DS18B20 [Temperature Sensor](https://github.com/xpix/XAmbi/tree/master/Xambi_kids/xambikid_DS18B20)\r\n- [Mailbox Sensor](https://github.com/xpix/XAmbi/tree/master/Xambi_kids/xambikid_mailbox) via infrared reflection\r\n- Plant [Moisture Sensor](https://github.com/xpix/XAmbi/tree/master/Xambi_kids/xambikid_moisture)\r\n\r\n##License\r\nGPL 3.0.
